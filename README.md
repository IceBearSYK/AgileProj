The forum-like web application is designed to provide a platform for users to engage in discussions.  It serves as an online community where users can create posts, comment on existing discussions, and interact with each other 

The frontend is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, with additional Javascript to add further utility.

The backend consists of a series of tables contructed on SQLite connected to the frontend using a combination of python, flask and SQAlchemy.

Through the combination fo these elements, the application allows users to navigate the webpage, create accounts, create forums and post on others forums.
